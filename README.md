## Notes

As I already had some idea about the basics of android development so making this app was not a tough task for me . But sure I learned some new things while finishing this pre-work, like I didn't have any idea about how to create a gif video of your app , I learned that. I didn't have any idea about the scale type property of image view because of this project I got to know about that etc.
